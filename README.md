SkyFlats SGP automates the capture of sky flats, by connecting and controlling SGP through its API.

The application is particularly targeted towards capturing so-called “blue sky” flats, just before and around sunset, which is possible with the short exposure times of CCD/CMOS cameras without mechanical shutters.

SkyFlats SGP dynamically changes the exposure times to reach the targeted ADU, within limits set by the user.

The Flat Sequencer handles different filters as needed, binning, etc., and it controls the mount to slew to different possible flat capture positions.

The flat sequencer is highly automatized, with the intent of being a “click and forget” application for capturing sky flats.
